# Uniswap Frontrun Bot
This is a Solidity contract for finding newly deployed contracts on the Uniswap exchange. The contract is designed to help users quickly identify new contracts that meet a specified liquidity requirement.
To use the contract, first deploy it to the Ethereum blockchain using a Solidity compiler such as Remix. Then, call the findNewContracts function and pass in two slices of data to compare. The function will return any new contracts that have the required liquidity.
